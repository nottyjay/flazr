flazr
=====

RTMP client in Java.

This is my fork of the project found at http://flazr.com, created because I prefer to develop in git than SVN.

I'm using this for some hobby projects, but feel free to submit issues and whatnot :)

About this repo
---------------

I'm working on some projects that use flazr and sometimes I need to make changes.
This proved difficult to keep track of, since I haven't used SVN for several years (git is my bread and butter now).


As such, I checked out r63 of the flazr subversion repository (http://sourceforge.net/p/flazr/code/HEAD/tree/) and created this repository to keep track of my work.

This should be considered a "fork" of the canonical flazr repo, from revision 63.
